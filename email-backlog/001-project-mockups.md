Hello David!

The team has already started working after our call this morning. We have sketched the web app platform mock-ups, a "map" of the views, and the possible navigation from and to each of them as well.
We took a picture of it and I have attached it to this email so you can take a look at it and tell us what you think about it. Did we miss something? Is it a good start? Or is it nothing like you envisioned it?

Let me just add here a quick reminder to keep in mind from now on until the rest of our collaboration: we are not designers, we are developers. That does not mean we won't give our best to make the platform look as good as possible, but it does mean however that our main focus is to assure everything is working as it should, and leave the appearance as a secondary task. So please bear in mind that when you look at the attached photo... :P we did our best designing the mock-ups!


"So... what happens now?" - you might be asking.

Well, now the team will elaborate a list of User Stories (US) - that is a list of tasks that are necessary to complete the project - and we will assign each US a certain number of points - a cost actually (it is not a monetary cost, it is the effort we think it will take to complete the US) - that being said, if one user story is harder than another, it will have a greater cost.

We can only fulfill a certain amount of points each week, and because of that - after we elaborate the list and assign each US an amount of points - you and me will have to make another hangouts call in order for me to understand which of the tasks have a higher priority. We will start implementing the higher ones, and only then move to the others, and so on and so on.

I hope this was not too confusing... But if you did not understand something please ask me and I will try to explain it again! :)


Looking forward to hear from you! And please give me some feedback about the mock-ups attached.

In behalf of the development team,
Henrique Ferrolho
