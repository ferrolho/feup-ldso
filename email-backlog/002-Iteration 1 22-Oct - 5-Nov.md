# Iteration 1: 22-Oct - 5-Nov

##### [Oct 29 - 2015] From: SM | To: PO, PM, SPO

Good morning David! :)

We are now right in the middle of the first iteration and we would like to share what we've been doing with you.

As for now, we have already implemented the authentication system: that means users can already register and sign in to the platform!  
The database is still being developed: users can have 4 roles and this is already in the DB, but they can not edit them yet.

We are currently working on USs 1-00 and 2-01. I have also sent you an invitation to the project account in Pivotal Tracker - this is where we update the user stories, their estimates, as well as their status. Can you confirm you have access to it and that you can see what user stories we are currently working on?  
Still regarding these user stories (the ones we are currently trying to implement), do you agree that we start with them? Or would you prefer we start with others? We chose these two because we think they are a good start.

I think that's all for now! :P

Kind regards in name of the dev team,  
Henrique Ferrolho.

Hi Henrique,  
I have access to pivotal tracker, thanks. Those two user stories are a great start.  
Thanks for the update.

Kind regards,  
David

Hello David! :)

We have setup an host for you to see how the product is going, you can access it here: http://ferrolho.xyz  
In Pivotal Tracker, we have delivered User Stories 0-00, 0-01, and 1-00. Can you please go to the link above, test those US and accept them in Pivotal Tracker? If you have any doubt please tell me right away!

Regards,  
Henrique Ferrolho.

Hi Henrique,

Thanks for the link. I'll go through it tomorrow morning and see if another member of my group can check it too.

Kind regards,  
David

Good night David! :)

I am still waiting for your feedback about the USs we have deployed to the hosting server. Did your meeting go well today morning? :) What did the group say about the site so far?

I bring good news! Meanwhile, we have already finished and deployed one more US: 1-01. You can test it and if you think it is ok you can press "accept" in pivotal tracker... :) This is important for us to keep it clean and organised.

Here is a screenshot of what you should be able to see in the supply page:  
*screenshot omitted *

Looking forward to hear from you,  
Henrique Ferrolho.

Thanks Henrique,  
I was busy writing a response when your email came earlier. I had to sign up again since the previous login credentials didn't work after your update.  
Sign up: No Problem. Were we not going to have more fields like country etc?  
Supply: Will the items donated be able to be categorised at some point? Wondering if the free text form field will make it difficult to sort or search food later. Your thoughts??  
Supply: Can there be a label on the amount field so one knows what they are inputting? My first thought was "should I put the number of oranges or the weight."  
Supply: If one presses "enter" without filling in something then all the items on the page disappear. They reappear when an item is input.  
supply: Can one edit or cancel an added resource? Is that still coming?

In pivotal tracker when I clicked on "accept" for 0-00 nothing happened.

The others haven't seen anything on the site yet. Hoping to get them all together or at least some of them. It didn't work out this morning to meet with them. I'll keep trying to get them together.

Chat soon.  
David

Good morning David :)

Every time we deploy a new feature we reset the DB - we are still testing, there's no harm doing this, and it assures us that there are no conflicts. The only down side is that you will have to sign up every time we deploy a new version, at least for now.

Sign up  
In the first mock-ups I've sent you, the sign up form also had the following fields: birth date, country, and city. We did not include them for now just for simplicity! Do you want us to add these to the current form?

Supply  
Categories: we did not think of this. If you would like to have a category associated with a supply offer, please elaborate a list of categories for us to make a drop down so the user can choose one of them when submitting a supply offer.  
Label: what kind of label are we talking about? Kg, L, quantity? Please elaborate a list for this as well. This is suitable for another drop down list next to the amount field.  
Empty field bug: I will look into this and solve it asap.  
Edit/cancel: Yes, this will be possible. You can check this US in pivotal tracker, it is US 1-02. It is still coming.

I guess I should be the one accepting/rejecting USs in pivotal tracker. I have accepted USs 0-00, 0-01, and 1-01. I have rejected US 1-00 because of the category and unit labels issue that needs to be solved.

Looking forward to know your feedback about these matters,  
Henrique Ferrolho.

Hi Henrique,  
Your points are noted. Here are my responses

Sign up:  I think at least country and city should be added since geography is the main differentiator. Area/ suburb can be added later?? People searching for things need local results returned so that need to be a backbone of the searching/ availability functionality.

Supply:  
Categories: I like the drop down list idea. I assume extra categories will be able to be added by administrators later on?? You can start with the following list  
--------  
Breads  
Vegetables  
Meat  
Sea Food  
Dairy  
Grains (pasta, rice etc)  
Fruits  
Condiments (sauces ,pesto etc)  
Drinkables  
Miscellaneous (Chips, biscuits, cooking oils, etc)  
-------------

Labels: Yes to drop-down too! Will admin be able to add more labels/ descriptors too?  
-----  
Quantity  
Kg  
Pieces  
Packets  
Cans  
Boxes  
Bottles  
Crates  
------

Kind regards,  
David
