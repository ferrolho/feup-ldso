# Iteration 1: 22-Oct - 5-Nov

##### [Oct 29 - 2015] From: SM | To: PO, PM, SPO

Good morning David! :)

We are now right in the middle of the first iteration and we would like to share what we've been doing with you.

As for now, we have already implemented the authentication system: that means users can already register and sign in to the platform!  
The database is still being developed: users can have 4 roles and this is already in the DB, but they can not edit them yet.

We are currently working on USs 1-00 and 2-01. I have also sent you an invitation to the project account in Pivotal Tracker - this is where we update the user stories, their estimates, as well as their status. Can you confirm you have access to it and that you can see what user stories we are currently working on?  
Still regarding these user stories (the ones we are currently trying to implement), do you agree that we start with them? Or would you prefer we start with others? We chose these two because we think they are a good start.

I think that's all for now! :P

Kind regards in name of the dev team,  
Henrique Ferrolho.
