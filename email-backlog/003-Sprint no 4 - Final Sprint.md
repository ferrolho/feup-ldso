# Sprint no. 4 - Final Sprint

##### [Dec 3 - 2015] From: SM | To: PO, PM, SPO

Good morning David,

Here is a list of requirements for your future development team:  
- Play Framework + Scala + Slick  
- HTML + CSS  
- SQL  
- JavaScript/CoffeeScript (not required, because it is very easy to learn)

We will dedicate this last sprint to try and fulfill the need of a better location/geography feature.

How do you expect this to be integrated in the sign up form? I guess that for a mobile phone number, a simple field will do it. But how about the city?  
What do you think about this solution: After the user selects a country, there would be another dropdown menu with all the cities of that country, and thus the user would have to select one of those?

I don't think we will have the time to implement the entire list you gave me, but let's hope so.

Best regards,  
Henrique Ferrolho.

Hi Henrique,  
Thanks! Yes the dropdown idea is great.

I understand that you have a large work load to manage. All I can ask is that you do your best to give us something usable. I appreciate all you have done.

Kind regards

Greetings David! :) And a happy new year!

Next Wednesday - 6th January - is our final presentation of the project we developed so far to the whole students of our current year. I think we have managed to do a very good work with the time we had. In fact, we are still working on some adjustments and trying to add the cities to the sign up form - we hope that this will be done by Wednesday.

So we are just about done. After our presentation we will tell you everything there is to know: what we did, what we had planned to do but has been left undone, and will give you the source code of the application.

I will request you one last thing, if you don't mind. We need to present your textual testimonial (mandatory) about the value of the product we have developed. Our teachers also asked for a short video (with a maximum of 90 seconds) - it is optional but we think it is much more pleasant to play this short video during the presentation than show a textual testimonial. Can you do that short video for us? :)

Thank you,  
Henrique Ferrolho.

Thank you all very much for your efforts and we look forward to using the system you have built for us.

Kind regards,  
David

Good afternoon David,

Thank you so much for taking the time to record the video. We really hope that what we have developed suits what you were hoping for.

Talk to you soon,  
Henrique Ferrolho.
