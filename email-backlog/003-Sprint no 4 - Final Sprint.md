# Sprint no. 4 - Final Sprint

##### [Dec 3 - 2015] From: SM | To: PO, PM, SPO

Good morning David,

Here is a list of requirements for your future development team:  
- Play Framework + Scala + Slick  
- HTML + CSS  
- SQL  
- JavaScript/CoffeeScript (not required, because it is very easy to learn)

We will dedicate this last sprint to try and fulfill the need of a better location/geography feature.

How do you expect this to be integrated in the sign up form? I guess that for a mobile phone number, a simple field will do it. But how about the city?  
What do you think about this solution: After the user selects a country, there would be another dropdown menu with all the cities of that country, and thus the user would have to select one of those?

I don't think we will have the time to implement the entire list you gave me, but let's hope so.

Best regards,  
Henrique Ferrolho.
