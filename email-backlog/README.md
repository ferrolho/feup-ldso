# Email Backlog

This is the Email Backlog folder.

This backlog contains all the emails exchanged between the **Product Owner** (PO), the **Project Manager** (PM), the **Surrogate Product Owner** (SPO), and the **Scrum Master** (SM).

Each of the logs contained in this folder represent a thread. The name of each log starts with a number for sorting purposes: the higher the number, the most recent the thread is.
